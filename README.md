# N-Queen Problem Solver with A* Algorithm

This C# project is designed to solve the N-Queen problem using the A* algorithm. The N-Queen problem involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. The A* algorithm is used to efficiently search for the optimal solution.

## Features

- Efficiently solves the N-Queen problem using the A* algorithm.
- Provides a user-friendly interface to visualize the chessboard and the solutions.
- Allows the user to specify the value of N (default value is 8).
- Provides detailed statistics about the search process, including the number of nodes expanded and the execution time.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in your preferred C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Build the project to ensure all dependencies are resolved.
4. Run the project.

Upon running the project, a graphical user interface will be displayed, allowing you to interact with the N-Queen solver. You can specify the value of N in the input field and click the "Solve" button to find the solutions. The interface will dynamically update to show the chessboard and highlight the queen placements. If a solution is found, it will be displayed on the chessboard.

## Example

Here's an example of running the project with N=8:

1. Run the project.
2. Set the value of N to 8 in the input field.
3. Click the "Solve" button.
4. The interface will display the chessboard with the queen placements.
